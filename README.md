# Spotlight Web

A minimal, fast, web-based tool effectively bringing a **macOS-like Spotlight search experience to Windows**, built with Tauri.

## Features

-   **Bang Patterns**: `g` (Google), `y` (YouTube), `gh` (GitHub).
-   **Smart URL Detection**: Automatically detects and opens URLs.
-   **Google Auto-Suggest**: Real-time search suggestions.
-   **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard control (Arrows, Enter, Tab, Esc).
-   **Draggable UI**: Click and drag anywhere (except interactive elements) to move the window.

## Why build this?

Firing quick queries on macOS is extremely convenient, and I wanted to bring that same efficiency to Windows because I am lazy and love the speed of Spotlight.

## Why only YouTube, GitHub, and Google as Bangs?

I am lazy again and spend ~95% of time on YouTube and random browsing.
